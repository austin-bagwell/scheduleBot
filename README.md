# scheduleBot

A logistics microservice that helps calculate the best day to ship an order for
a given customer by checking historic shipment data using vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, and Express.

Project structure currently isn't loading modules into the index.html being served to localhost:3000. Gotta sort out Express routing to fix that I think. Also, the database isn't actually connected to the app in any real way at this point.

Eventually I'll have a RESTful API alongisde a MySQL - right now it just uses dummy data. Current version (after file structure changes) is non-functional, which I'm noting here so that I'll remember what I need to fix!
