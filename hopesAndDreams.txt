Basically taking all the backend structure from:
https://github.com/bezkoder/nodejs-express-mysql/blob/master/app/controllers/tutorial.controller.js

Big refactor --

Step 0 here is to use the most basic data possible -- consignees and their average time in transit. That's it. No analysis, no individual shipments. Maybe a unique ID for each consignee to keep things straight in the DB. No fluff.

TODO
finish setting up consignee.model.js --- I need to write all the DB methods still

TODO
sort out actually connecting to MySQL
